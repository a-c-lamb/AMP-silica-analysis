These analysis files are for aminopropyl functionalised silica slabs in vacuum

4, 12 and 20 are the number of aminopropyl chains on the silica surface.
The denticity is indicated by the third letter in APM, APB or APT. They are monodentate, bidentate or tridentate, which are 1, 2 or 3 bonds between the central organic silicon and the silica.
